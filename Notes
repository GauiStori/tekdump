Notes while writing program to collect screendumps from Tek 11801A
sampling scope.

Connected RS232 port on scope to port on guilder (pc w/linux)
set both ends to 19200bps, soft flagging (XON/XOFF)

See also: page 192 of the 11801A user reference manual, Setting
RS-232C parameters.

Set up 11801A hardcopy modes for Bitmap dump,
direction=horizontal, screen format = screen, data format as below.

(first few tries used direction=vertical; when this is done the resulting image
needs to be rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise)

Collected data using simple script

sample.bhex - binhex
sample.bhexc - binhex compressed
sample.binc - binary compressed

Using the information on page 121 of the 11801A user reference manual,
it should be easy to write a program to recode these formats into
a standard bitmap image format, such as ppm.

Started writing a program called tekdump to convert these data formats
to PPM.  The manual is unclear on the color mapping of the 3-bit
pixels contained in the dump, but otherwise it was straightforward.
